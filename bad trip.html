                        <P> MAIN CAST: In small-town Florida, Chris is working at a car wash when a woman, Maria, arrives. Chris tells the man whose car he's washing that she is his high school crush. He begins to vacuum the car but the overpowered vacuum sucks his clothes off, leaving him naked. He panics and hides in the car. The man has a conversation with Maria, attempting to get her number for Chris, but she declines and leaves.
                            Chris' best friend, Bud, is working at a computer shop, where his sister, Trina, pulls up in her car. After having a conversation with two customers, she begs Bud for money but he refuses. Although on house arrest, she robs the store and removes her ankle tag, gives money to the two customers, warning them not to snitch. Later, Chris and Bud talk about Trina, Maria, and going on big adventures.
