                        <P> MAIN CAST: Annie Walker is a single woman in her mid-thirties, living in Milwaukee. Her bakery failed due to the recession, wiping out her savings, and her boyfriend left her thereafter. Having lost her passion, she works at a jewelry store and shares an apartment with eccentric British immigrant siblings Gil and Brynn. Annie has a casual sexual relationship with the wealthy and self-absorbed Ted, but hopes for something more from him. The only positive presence in her life is her lifelong best friend Lillian. When Lillian becomes engaged to her boyfriend Doug, she asks Annie to be her maid of honor.</P>
