                        <P> MAIN CAST: Ruth Slater is released from prison after serving twenty years for murdering a sheriff who came to evict her and her five year old sister Katie, whom Ruth was raising in their childhood home after the death of their father, their mother having died during childbirth. Upon her release, Ruth is introduced to her PO, Vince, and obtains two jobs, all while searching for her estranged younger sister. Katie, now living with a foster family, barely remembers Ruth, but experiences memories of trauma. These memories cause Katie to be involved in a car accident, and she is forced to return to her foster parents’ home while she recovers. Katie’s foster parents worry that her memories of Ruth, as well as the fact that she may be somehow aware of her release, is what caused the accident. They agree that they were right to hide the truth of the past from Katie, and agree to continue to for her own good, as a sister who is a convicted murderer can offer her nothing.</P>
